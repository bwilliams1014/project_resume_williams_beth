			<img src="img/BethWilliams.jpg" alt="image of me"/>
			<p>Hi! I'm Beth Williams - designer, creator, teacher, and multi-tasking graduate student in the University of Floridaâ€™s Master of Arts in Mass Communication Web Design and Online Communication program. Originally from North Carolina, I now call Fleming Island, FL (which is just outside of Jacksonville) home.</p>
			<p>I enjoy the creative freedom of the design process as well as the logical aspect of coding. It's both satisfying and rewarding to bring a design to life in its full responsive and interactive form.</p>
			<p>I have two sons that are grown and flown, and two cats that are spoiled. I like traveling and trying new things such as skydiving and river rafting. I'm a Harry Potter fan (the books, not the movies) and have mastered the voices of all the main characters. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the NC State Wolfpack are my teams, and I love watching the women's national soccer team play whenever I get a chance.</p>
